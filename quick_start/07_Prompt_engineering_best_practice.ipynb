    "## How Prompt Engineering Works\n",
    "Due to the way OpenAI models are trained, certain prompt formats work particularly well and lead to more useful [model outputs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models). The [official OpenAI prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) is a good starting point for learning general prompt tips. Below, we outline several prompt formats that we found to work well, but feel free to explore other formats that may better suit your tasks.\n",
